ned
   need a way to clear find hilites (other than find empty string)
   fix paste cuz it often fails (copy seems fine, paste ain't)
   during replace, if it won't fit within line, warn but don't stop

l
   dir arg
   load n use .hidden
   use l.cfg to sort .ext s properly and give files a tag
      hilites with color?  icons?

ftx
   kick ned with lineno upon dblclick on right pane line
   enclose any space in findstr for ned

undup
   spin it off in a sep thread with a "wait" and cancel dialog
   cuz i think that's killin it (often sigh)
